# HTTPS Security Protocol Implementation

This project demonstrates a simplified implementation of the HTTPS protocol using Python. It includes a secure server and client setup that communicates over TLS encryption using the `ssl` and `socket` libraries.

## Features

- **Secure Server (`SecureHTTPServer`)**
  - Hosts a secure HTTP server with TLS encryption.
  - Responds to client requests with a simple plaintext HTTP response.

- **Secure Client (`SecureHTTPClient`)**
  - Establishes a secure connection with the server.
  - Sends an HTTP GET request over TLS and prints the server's response.

- **Self-Signed Certificates**
  - Generates a self-signed certificate and private key for testing purposes.
  - Demonstrates how certificates can be programmatically created for secure communication.

## How It Works

1. **Server Setup:**
   - A secure server socket is created and wrapped with TLS encryption using the provided certificate and key.
   - The server listens for incoming connections and responds to HTTP GET requests.

2. **Client Setup:**
   - The client verifies the server's identity using the provided CA certificate.
   - Establishes a TLS connection and sends a request.

3. **Communication:**
   - The server and client communicate securely over TLS, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `cryptography` library

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## Usage

### Running the Example

1. Install the required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python https_security_protocol.py
   ```

3. The server will start on `https://localhost:8443`, and the client will connect to it, demonstrating secure communication.

### Example Output

The script will produce output showcasing the following:
- **Server Output**:
  - Logs indicating incoming connections and requests from clients.
  - Example: 
    ```
    Secure HTTP Server started at https://localhost:8443
    Connection from ('127.0.0.1', 12345)
    Received request:
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost
    Connection: close
    ```

- **Client Output**:
  - The client will display the HTTP response received from the server.
  - Example:
    ```
    Response from server:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain

    Secure Hello World!
    ```

## Security Features

- **TLS Encryption**: Ensures that all communication between the server and client is encrypted, protecting data from interception.
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: The server uses a certificate to authenticate itself to the client. The client verifies the server's identity before proceeding.
- **Threaded Server**: The server handles multiple client connections simultaneously, demonstrating concurrency.

## Limitations

- **Self-Signed Certificates**: This example generates self-signed certificates for testing purposes. In production, replace them with certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Simplified HTTP Implementation**: The script provides basic HTTP request/response functionality. Extend or integrate with existing frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django) for more comprehensive web server capabilities.

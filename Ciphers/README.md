# Block Cipher Modes Demonstration

This repository demonstrates various block cipher modes.
Each mode is implemented with simplified logic to showcase how block cipher modes operate. These implementations use mock encryption for demonstration purposes and are not designed for use in real-world applications.

## Disclaimer

**This implementation is for educational purposes only.** It is intended to provide a conceptual understanding of block cipher modes. For production or security-critical applications, always use trusted cryptographic libraries such as:

- **OpenSSL**
- **Crypto++**

These libraries are optimized for performance and include robust, tested implementations of encryption algorithms and modes.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by adding other block cipher modes or improving the existing implementations.

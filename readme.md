# Security Protocol Simulations

This project is dedicated to the simulation and demonstration of various security protocols. Each protocol is implemented with a focus on showcasing its core functionality and potential applications in real-world scenarios.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an educational resource for understanding and experimenting with security protocols. Each implementation includes examples of how the protocol works and demonstrates its practical usage.

## Features

- **Protocol Simulations**: Implementations of key security protocols, focusing on encryption, authentication, and secure communication.
- **Modular Structure**: Each protocol is developed as an independent module, allowing for easy exploration and future extensions.
- **Real-World Examples**: Practical scenarios are provided to illustrate how each protocol is applied.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the protocol folder of interest and read the instructions provided within.

3. Install any required dependencies listed in the respective module.

4. Run the scripts to observe the protocol's functionality in action:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

## Purpose of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To serve as a hands-on learning tool for students and developers interested in cybersecurity.
- To create a flexible framework for experimenting with and extending security protocols.
- To provide clear and concise implementations of complex protocols for better understanding.
